1,TomCruise,would you still watch Tom Cruise if it turned out he was a gay guy?,"Tom cruise being secretly gay is a perfect example of reality mimicking art. SOUTHPARK called it. They just did. 

Tom Cruise does a lot of gay stuff, and thats fine, its as high five worthy as plowing a woman nowadays. 

In fact, for the potential homophobes out here lets do a mind experiment. 

You are still a teen, younger than you are nowadays. Your mom and dad broke up. Its sad totally. But now its been a year, or two infact. You are getting over it. Your dad comes in one day and says ""son I have something to tell you"": 

In one scenario: your dad says:
A.) I just plowed a hot new bird, she was nothing like your mom, this one was hot, and didn't have your ugly little squished up nose that you totally got from her "" 

He chucks you a beer. And says ""high-five!?"" 

Do you leave him hanging? 

Sucks your parents broke up. But you don't leave the old man hanging. Now that would be criminal. (Go directly to jail, don't pass go, do not collect 200 monopoly monies) 

Now imagine he instead says:
""Yo kiddo, I just found out I like to slam ass with my buddy Rick. He has an ass like a meat grinder and my cock is shredded like a homoerotic bodybuilder. Behold the hand that Rick came on. I shall never wash it, he said it was lumpy because it was ""Curdled Cum"", now son, I don't care about your opinions for me, but I must insist on a.  ""high five!?"" 

If you reached the end of that thought experiment without atleast shaking your old mans hand, you are pretty much 100% a massive homophobe (a bad person). But good news is, you CAN change! 

And behold, as rare an opportunity as it is, this is the perfect chance for homophobes to see being gay isn't weird. Because Tom Cruise has been spending his time doing some genuinely weird stuff. If you are homophobic, go watch some gay porn then read the rest of this stuff, see what he's REALLY been up to. Admire the contrast. 

Back? 

most of his time nowadays meditating on a human pyramid of scientology members. He calls it a cult stack. Anyone who interrupts him whilst he is ""ontop of the world"", ""the king of the castle"" or ""riding on sunshine"", well them he calls a ""cunt stack"" for interrupting his ""cult-stack"".
At times he is seen riding the shoulders of his gardener, 'Hector', who just so happens to be rather anxious about his height, he is a man of tall stature - unlike Mr. Cruise (which Hector must never call his boss btw, he must be refered to as ""the Boss-Man"" - never lil'/little Boss-man... [we lost the last few Hector's that way], other acceptable titles are 'Maverick' and if you are to be deemed his special-maid [female and/or male, and by male, I mean one of the former Hector's left the Cruise Mansion in a dress the other week, he failed in his duties, and was promptly 'fired' after 'quitting' out of turn. 

Its okay. His family haven't seen anything of the general Piriah of a man, and Mr. Cruise has his new Hector], then and only then will he allow you to call him 'Crusty'. If you find yourself calling Tom Cruise 'Crusty' at any time, it is the convention to go get -tested- treated* for herpes, chlamydia, hepititis, HIV, some kind of weird skin eating genital disease (funnily enough first discovered on Tom Cruise! 

Another fun fact: he's for some reason resistant to it and is simply a carrier! 

Another fun fact: you're not! It makes your teeth fall out and if youre a dude it makes your 'willy' look funny, and doctors think its worth researching and publishing their findings on the rare few whos ""dick has went on a CRUISE to the titanic"".
       ^----- a joke phrase popular with dick doctors when referencing this phenomenon, so much that they called it ""titanicalur cruise-rot of the dick"". 

It also has the side effect of making your voice sound like a potentially famous voice actor, and instantly awakened 'backflipping skill', its awakening ancient genes that are normally dormant in 99.999% of humans because dominant instead. 

Forced to express their genetic code, to entirely unforseen results, the genes that store our ancestors genetic memories of 'backflipping' alongside the genes responsible for all those ancestors nasty venereal diseases and bad choices were awakened. All at once.

Anyways Tom Cruise would be riding Hector's shoulders, as he always does, claiming wildly that he is ""perhaps the greatest actor of all time, but it is important to stay humble. And vigilant. I am but a simple man, I know not what I do or how I got there. I am a product of a rich a vibrant history. 

He would then say, with this stupid ass grin on his face. ""Historically speaking I am *standing on the shoulders of giants"". Thats literally what the man said, just chuffed to bits with himself, proud as out. 

and then..
*fkkkknn nyyyyaannnn - he zooms past like crazy*
Like he's possessed. 

Looking back I guess it was Hector who should of been exhausted. Hector was 'the Camera Man' to Tom Cruises 'Bear Grylls' that day. Thats for sure. Beyond that I was left to find my own way out, I wanted to bring my friend Hector with me, but by that point I was deeply immersed in Scientology. After all: Aliens. 

So I changed everything about myself and reconstructed myself in Tom Cruises image, not like he did himself (with plastic surgery) and not in his literal image, he said that wasn't possible, (I'm too handsome and funny) instead we used the image he chose for me, especially for me because I am ""unique"", ""smart"", ""funny"", ""great to be around"" - my friend Crusty said that about me. And its true. I am smart and funny. 

- Hector 

P.S don't even get me started on Britney Spears or Terry Cruise. (They were both great in white chicks) 

P.S.S for seriously now, as I might admit some of the above stories might have been slightly over exaggerated. Its more a case of retelling the same story over and over and changing it a lil' bit every time. To keep it fresh to me and exciting for the audience. And I guess it got out of hand. I do have some 100% genuine celebrity stories and I can tell you the barebones basics of one of them to make up for some of the minor inconsistencies from my (I still argue to be) good piece of mostly honest journalism, above. 

So, I worked as for a security company  not directly for Tom, but we were known to work with celebrities from time to time, we were booked to a private Villa Tom Cruise have a fist fight with Kevin Bacon, and the story should of just been over. I don't even need to say who won. what happened. and/or why any of that would be relevant. It speaks for itself. And it goes without saying he deserved that for what he did but I will still watch his movies, but I don't like how he lost, it wasn't fair, it was dirty and I didn't expect that from him, one man left dancing worse for wear and the other was left with a bad haircut after a hair pull and a kick to the knee, followed by a quick one-two to the shin. Finished by a stern jab,  quick left jab it was. He never saw it coming. There really was no moral to the story. And i don't think it resolved anything. It was just good old fashioned journalism material. Every goddamn day of the week. 

I thank you all. Go with Christ!

Please donate to the below charity if you have enjoyed my 'journalism' and overall 'political statement', if you have found yourself enjoying and embracing 'my style' as I am known to be a rather 'dapper gentleman. I wear good threads. They look good on me and I am voted very highly when it comes to being the ""best dressed man in the world"", I come 1943th. But look at it in perspective, please.

Although you should not feel bad if you haven't donated. You are in fact a bad person and you should probably be 'going back' and 'going ahead' to do that,
If you don't donate, we would like to thank anyone who leaves a comment anyways, the donation totally isn't obligatory. We will reply to some comments. We will call you out publicly if you don't donate or if we think you are 'stingy' or other 'bad person' traits. If you are called out also donate to the charity below. Thank you. 

I particularly like this one as it shows you where your money goes, it helps make renewable water sources, recycling human waste, you can see when new Wells are made using your money. I think this is so important, for transparency when it comes to where the donaters money goes. More charities should be like this and I shall fund the way to starting my own shortly,
Believe it or not I have helped in raisng well over 1 million gbp for charity in my life (true and verifiable) and I will go on to keep trying to make more. There's a reason I managed to earn money in the name of a good cause when I couldn't earn that same money in the name of myself, and its because people, for the most part, are good. Some are disenfranchised and some are just so tired from trying to get by themselves. But they are good. And many will help and did and will again; to make a difference. A different world for the youth to grow up in

#trolls for charity
&lt;3 thank you my little jesuses 

A final charity close to my heart. I can't explain why without Doxxing myself. 

The GNAA, the Great North Air Ambulance,
A public funded charity in the UK.
Provides all helicopters used in the saving of lives performed by the NHS in emergency situations on many an unlucky event and day.
This is a UK charity, it is not at all funded by the NHS, it would not exist without donations,  the flights cost 1k either way give or take, in fuel alone, whether they are used or not. If it wasn't for this service, person/s I know wouldn't be around now. We have helped to raise money to show thanks for over a decade now. But we will continue until our own dying days. 
Thank you the GNAA. You are a crown jewel of England,  you are up there with the BBC, the Pubs and the Royal Family. 

Link for donating the the GNAA to help save lives that need urgent assistance they otherwise would not have the opportunity to get:
